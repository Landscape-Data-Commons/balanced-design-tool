<p>Polygon shapefiles are complex things and unfortunately this tool
can’t identify and repair all of the possible sources of problems that
will cause it to fail.</p>
<p>Almost all crashes due to shapefile geometry (that the tool’s repair
option does not correct) can be solved one of two ways:</p>
<p><strong>1) Dissolving</strong>: Dissolving the polygons by the
stratification field is easy and works in almost every case. If there
are other attributes of the polygons that you want to preserve but will
be lost in the dissolve (<em>e.g.</em> multiple polygons belong to the
same stratum but it is important to capture that they belong to
different administrative units), be sure to retain those polygons with
the full information and create a new, separate shapefile from the
dissolve process.</p>
<p><strong>2) Buffering</strong>: Buffering the polygons by a distance
of 0 units can also solve crashes. This will cause no user-noticeable
changes to the polygons or their attributes, but does generally force
tiny changes to the underlying geometry that correct common issues like
slivers or discontinuities. Note that not all geoprocessing software
will allow for buffering with a distance of 0.</p>
<p>If you are encountering repeated crashing with a shapefile, even with
the option to check and repair geometry selected, chances are that there
are some irregularities or errors in the geometry that crept in during
the geoprocessing that created the polygons. These are almost always due
to quirks of the geoprocessing software rather than mistakes on a user’s
part. Many geometry errors may not be readily apparent, especially if
you use Arc software like ArcGIS which does an excellent job of glossing
over and working around most geometry errors, making them invisible to
users. Another cause can be memory allocation issues for particularly
complicated polygons. This seems to happen most often when there are
dozens to thousands of entries per stratum in the polygon attributes
instead of a single entry for each. However, some sets of polygons may
be complex enough that this tool will be unable to handle them.</p>
