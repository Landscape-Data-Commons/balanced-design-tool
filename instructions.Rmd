### 1) Upload a zipped polygon shapefile
This should be a .ZIP file containing only the components of a single polygon shapefile. For example, if the shapefile were named "rio_grande_strata" the .ZIP would need to contain:

  - rio_grande_strata.dbf
  - rio_grande_strata.prj
  - rio_grande_strata.sbn
  - rio_grande_strata.shp
  - rio_grande_strata.shx

### 2) Name the project
This will default to the name of the shapefile, but you can change it to anything composed of only alphanumeric characters and underscores.

### 3) Select a field to stratify by
Your options are the variables/attribute fields in your shapefile. If you aren't stratifying, use the option "Do not stratify".

### 4) Update stratification
Clicking the button will start the next step and kick off background processing to prepare for the draw.

### 5) Decide how to allocate the points
Select the style of allocation and then the details.

### 6) Update allocation information
Clicking the button commits your decisions and makes it possible to fetch a sample draw. You can still change your allocation, but need to click the button to commit the changes.

### 7) Fetch the points
Clicking the button will generate a sample draw and display it on a map.

### 8) Download the points
If the design meets expectations, this button will download a .ZIP containing the sample design and everything necessary to recreate it in the future in R without this tool.
